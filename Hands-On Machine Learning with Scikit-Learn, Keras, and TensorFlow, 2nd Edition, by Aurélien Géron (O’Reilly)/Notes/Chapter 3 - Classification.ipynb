    "A much better way to evaluate the performance of a classifier is to look at the **confusion matrix**. The general idea is to count the number of times instances of class A are classified as class B. For example, to know the number of times the classifier confused images of 5s with 3s, you would look in the fifth row and third column of the confusion matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the confusion matrix, you first need to have a set of predictions so that they can be compared to the actual targets. You could make predictions on the test set, but let’s keep it untouched for now (remember that you want to use the test set only at the very end of your project, once you have a classifier that you are ready to launch). Instead, you can use the cross_val_predict() function:\n",

The second row considers the images of 5s (the positive class): 1,325 were wrongly classified as non-5s (false negatives), while the remaining 4,096 were correctly classified as 5s (true positives).

    "Scikit-Learn provides several functions to compute classifier metrics, including precision and recall:\n",

    "\n",
    "It is often convenient to combine precision and recall into a single metric called the $F_1$ score, in particular if you need a simple way to compare two classifiers. The $F_1$ score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall (Equation 3-3). Whereas the regular mean treats all values equally, the harmonic mean gives much more weight to low values. As a result, the classifier will only get a high $F_1$ score if both recall and precision are high.\n",

    "0.7420962043663375\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The $F_1$ score favors classifiers that have similar precision and recall. This is not always what you want: in some contexts you mostly care about precision, and in other contexts you really care about recall. For example, if you trained a classifier to detect videos that are safe for kids, you would probably prefer a classifier that rejects many good videos (low recall) but keeps only safe ones (high precision), rather than a classifier that has a much higher recall but lets a few really bad videos show up in your product (in such cases, you may even want to add a human pipeline to check the classifier’s video selection). On the other hand, suppose you train a classifier to detect shoplifters in surveillance images: it is probably fine if your classifier has only $30\\%$ precision as long as it has $99\\%$ recall (sure, the security guards will get a few false alerts, but almost all shoplifters will get caught).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, you can’t have it both ways: increasing precision reduces recall, and vice versa. This is called the **precision/recall trade-off.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Precision/Recall Trade-of \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this trade-off, let’s look at how the SGDClassifier makes its classification decisions. For each instance, it computes a score based on a decision function. If that score is greater than a threshold, it assigns the instance to the positive class; otherwise it assigns it to the negative class. Figure 3-3 shows a few digits positioned from the lowest score on the left to the highest score on the right. If you raise the threshold (move it to the arrow on the right), you will increase the precision. Conversely, lowering the threshold increases recall and reduces precision.\n",

    "![image.png](attachment/image-3.3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn does not let you set the threshold directly, but it does give you access to the decision scores that it uses to make predictions. Instead of calling the classifier’s `predict()` method, you can call its `decision_function()` method, which returns a score for each instance, and then use any threshold you want to make predictions based on those scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> y_scores = sgd_clf.decision_function([some_digit])\n",
    ">>> y_scores\n",
    "array([2412.53175101])\n",
    ">>> threshold = 0\n",
    ">>> y_some_digit_pred = (y_scores > threshold)\n",
    "array([ True])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SGDClassifier` uses a threshold equal to $0$, so the previous code returns the same result as the `predict()` method (i.e., True). Let’s raise the threshold:\n",

    "curve in Figure 3-4 is that precision may sometimes go down when you raise the threshold (although in general it will go up). To understand why, look back at Figure 3-3 and notice what happens when you start from the central threshold and move it just one digit to the right: precision goes from $4/5\\ (80\\%)$ down to $3/4\\ (75\\%)$. On the other hand, recall can only go down when the threshold is increased, which explains why its curve looks smooth.\n",

It is very similar to the precision/recall curve, but instead of plotting precision versus recall, the ROC curve plots the **true positive rate** (another name for recall) against the **false positive rate** (FPR). The FPR is the ratio of negative instances that are incorrectly classified as positive. It is equal to $1$ – the true negative rate (TNR), which is the ratio of negative instances that are correctly classified as negative. The TNR is also called specificity. Hence, the ROC curve plots **sensitivity** (recall) versus $1$ – **specificity**.\n",

    "Whereas binary classifiers distinguish between two classes, multiclass classifiers (also called multinomial classifiers) can distinguish between more than two classes. Some algorithms (such as SGD classifiers, Random Forest classifiers, and naive Bayes classifiers) are capable of handling multiple classes natively. Others (such as Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machine classifiers) are strictly binary classifiers. However, there are various strategies that you can use to perform multiclass classification with multiple binary classifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way is to train $10$ binary classifiers, one for each digit (a $0$-detector, a $1$-detector, a $2$- detector, and so on). Then when you want to classify an image, you get the decision score from each classifier for that image and you select the class whose classifier outputs the highest score. This is called the **one-versus-the-rest** (OvR) strategy (also called **one-versus-all**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another strategy is to train a binary classifier for every pair of digits: one to distinguish 0s and 1s, another to distinguish $0$s and $2$s, another for $1$s and $2$s, and so on. This is called the **one-versus-one** (OvO) strategy. If there are $N$ classes, you need to train $N\\ ×\\ (N\\ –\\ 1)\\ /\\ 2$ classifiers. For the MNIST problem, this means training $45$ binary classifiers! When you want to classify an image, you have to run the image\n",
    "through all $45$ classifiers and see which class wins the most duels. The main advantage of OvO is that each classifier only needs to be trained on the part of the training set for the two classes that it must distinguish.\n",

    "Some algorithms (such as Support Vector Machine classifiers) scale poorly with the size of the training set. For these algorithms OvO is preferred because it is faster to train many classifiers on small training sets than to train few classifiers on large training sets. For most binary classification algorithms, however, OvR is preferred.\n",

However, most misclassified images seem like obvious errors to us, and it’s hard to understand why the classifier made the mis‐ takes it did.3 The reason is that we used a simple SGDClassifier, which is a linear model. All it does is assign a weight per class to each pixel, and when it sees a new image it just sums up the weighted pixel intensities to get a score for each class. So since 3s and 5s differ only by a few pixels, this model will easily confuse them. \n",

In other words, this classifier is quite sensitive to image shifting and rotation. So one way to reduce the 3/5 confusion would be to preprocess the images to ensure that they are well centered and not too rotated. This will probably help reduce other errors as well.\n",

Then when the classifier is shown a picture of Alice and Charlie, it should output [1, 0, 1] (meaning “Alice yes, Bob no, Charlie yes”).

To illustrate this, let’s build a system that removes noise from images. It will take as input a noisy digit image, and it will (hopefully) output a clean digit image, repre‐ sented as an array of pixel intensities, just like the MNIST images.
